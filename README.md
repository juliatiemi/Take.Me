Files Take1, Take2, Take3 are all written in C.
For compiling Take1.c, do not forget to add -lm at the end of the command.

Question - 1
Prime numbers
Given an input variable N, where N > 0, print the next 10 prime numbers that are larger then N. Read the value of N from thestandard input.

Question - 2
Take Net
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to N where N > 1. However, for multiples of three print "Take" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five print "Net". For the numbers that are multiples of both three and five, print "TakeNet". Read in the input number N fromstandard input and print the results to the standard output.

Question - 3
Fibonacci
The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence Fn of natural numbers defined:
F0 = 0
F1 = 1
Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2, if n>1
Write a function to generate the nth Fibonacci number, reading the value of N from the standard input and printing the result to the standard output.

Question - 4
List
What happens when the following code is executed?
var list = new List<String> { "take", "net" };
for (int i = 0; i < list.Count; i++) {
  list.Add(list[i].ToUpper());
}
[ ] Changes all list values to uppercase.
[ ] Keeps the first two items in lowercase and adds new items in uppercase.
[ ] Out of memory exception.
[ ] Only the values "TAKE" and "NET" will be added to the list.
[ ] Index out of boundsexception.
